conference goers! Argue about semicolons, bet on best talks, and preregister for
your badge while you&#39;re there. Lucky for you, this year&#39;s sponsor of all things
beer, <a href="https://careers-bazaarvoice.icims.com/jobs/1371/job">Bazaarvoice</a>, will be
picking up the tab. Come in, find the nerds handing out badges and tickets, and
have a good time. The free drinks end at 8pm, but feel free to stay longer and

in. There will be a table and a line. If you already registered at the drink-up the night
before, feel free to come in right away (but don&#39;t forget your badge!).</p>
<p>Once inside, we&#39;ll provide copious amounts of delicious <a href="http://tacodeli.com/">TacoDeli</a>
breakfast tacos to start your day off the Austin way. Grab a taco or two (vegetarian tacos
too!), find your friends and get seated in the theatre and get settled for the day.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>We will have designated areas for power around the theatre, just look for the strips. Some
of the seats closer to the middle may have limited access. We&#39;ll also have some visible
power strips in the lobby in case you have a great idea that you need to implement before
you can continue listening.</p>
<h3>WiFi</h3>
<p>Our very gracious WiFi Sponsor, <a href="http://www.volusion.com/careers/">Volusion</a>, has upped the
ante this year. We&#39;re doing our best to bring in some top tech to keep everyone connected
throughout the day on all 9 of their devices! That said, we appreciate your cooperation in
turning off Dropbox, automatic backups, and those Season 3 Game of Thrones torrents (the
books are better anyway). We also ask that while it&#39;s nifty to try to find yourself in the
livestream, please don&#39;t try to watch it on the conference network.</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>While we want everyone to have a good time, we want to ensure that everyone feels welcome
while at TXJS. We&#39;re reluctant to post specific rules around behavior, as they always come
with loopholes. We would ask that you act in a professional manner and respect others. As
we&#39;ve suggested in years past, act as if Douglas Crockford was sitting both to the left
<strong>and</strong> right of you at all times. Jokes aside, if you have any trouble please
<strong>bring it to the attention of a staff member immediately</strong> (you can email <a href="mailto:alexsexton+txjs@gmail.com">Alex</a> or find anyone with a staff badge). The staff will deal with issues promptly and privately. We reserve the right to ask especially unsavory folks to leave, but we trust y&#39;all and aren&#39;t worried.</p>

will be about 25 minutes.</p>
<h3>Dave Rupert</h3>
<h4>HTML: Do we really need the L?</h4>
<p>Dave will be giving an overview of how badass HTML5 is (in regards to mobile). Specifically,
what we can do with it, and how we can make things better for people.</p>
<p><a href="http://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> is the lead developer of <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a>.
He co-hosts <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">ShopTalk</a>, a sound effects podcast that
also covers web development, with fellow TXJS speaker Chris Coyier. He also co-hosts the
<a href="http://atxwebshow.com/">ATX Web Show</a>, a podcast about the web design and development scene
in Austin, TX. On the internets he&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">davatron5000</a>.</p>
<h3>Nicole Sullivan</h3>
<h4>OOCSS and Preprocessors in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G</h4>
<p>Many developers believe they need to choose between OOCSS and CSS preprocessors like SASS/Compass and LESS.
Nicole believes that the best sites pair the strengths of both approaches, pulling the architecture from OOCSS
and the language additions from SASS. She will share with you some of her war stories, including everything she
screwed up when switching to using preprocessors and how she finally found a balanced approach to developing
large sites using preprocessors.</p>
<p>Nicole is a UI performance nerd living and working in San Francisco. She helps companies make their CSS smaller
and their UI more manageable. She is also an author, most recently contributing to the Web Performance Daybook
Volume 2. Photo taken by <a href="http://subism.com/">John Morrison</a>.</p>
<h3>Chris Coyier</h3>
<h4>CSS is for Computers</h4>
<p>We don&#39;t write programs in ones and zeros. We&#39;re many, many layers abstracted from that now. Those abstractions
make programming powerful and practical. With the internet, we got a fresh start with the languages it digests:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While these languages are quite a bit more &quot;authorable&quot; than ones and zeros, it&#39;s time
we take a step up the abstraction ladder. Using preprocessors, we can author websites in a more powerful, practical,
and efficient manner. We&#39;ll talk specifically about CSS preprocessing using Sass and Compass.</p>
<p>Chris is the force behind <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>; previously he was with Wufoo and SurveyMonkey as
Lead Hucklebucker. Chris is a Wordpress expert and author of <a href="http://digwp.com/">Digging into Wordpress</a>
 and the <a href="http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-3-tutorials/creating-and-editing-custom-themes/67160-2.html">Lynda.com Wordpress 3</a>
tutorial series. He is also the host of a kick-ass podcast the <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalk Show</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href=#lunch>Lunch in Town</a></h2>
        <div class="details"><p>Downtown Austin is one of the best places to be hungry in the entire world. After careful consideration,
we decided that making you eat conference food within walking distance of <a href="http://hotdogscoldbeer.com/">Frank</a>
would likely get us in trouble with someone.</p>
<p>You should be able to get in and out of most places in an hour and half, but please choose wisely if you find
yourself in a line.</p>
<p>Here is our <strong>no-bull-honky list of pretty great places that you should use yer eatin&#39;-mouth at</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/OnCN6">Frank</a> - Gourmet Hotdogs &amp; Good Coffee</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/VWHCn">Roaring Fork</a> - Fancy American (The Big Ass Burger is delicious)</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/o8gHO">Thai Passion</a> - Pretty deece Thai Food</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/TF3aM">Kebabalicious</a> - Delicious Falafels and Kebabs. An Austin Food Truck Staple™</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/TF3aM">BD Riley&#39;s Pub</a> - Good Pub Food and Beer</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ozc5M">Lambert&#39;s BBQ</a> - A bit further out, sometimes slow, but if you <strong>need</strong> BBQ, go here</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/uFGG3">La Condesa</a> - Some of the best Mexican food in town. You&#39;d need to move quick, though</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/prqpn">Casino El Camino</a> - Some damn good burgers and burger mashups</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/bSq3Q">Easy Tiger</a> - Beer Garden and Grub</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/60XpP">Cafe Medici</a> - Not a restaurant, just damn good <a href="http://cuveecoffee.com/">Austin Texas Roasted Coffee</a></li>

of other options. While you may read a lot about <a href="http://franklinbarbecue.com/">Franklin Barbecue</a>, they&#39;ll likely be out of
food by the time lunch starts, so go wait in line at 10am the day after the conference :D.</p>

        <div class="details"><p>This set of speakers will be talking about the ins and outs of building web applications. Each talk
will be about 25 minutes.</p>
<h3>Trek Glowacki</h3>
<h4>JavaScript Application Frameworks</h4>
<p>Trek will be talking a bit about JavaScript Application frameworks. As a user of and contributor
to many of the most popular libraries and frameworks, Trek has some unique insights into what makes
these tools different, and what their best uses are.</p>
<p>Trek helped start <a href="http://workantile.com/">Workantile</a> and currently makes mischief in Chicago.
He&#39;s on the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.JS</a> core team. <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a> once
called him &#39;a hero&#39;. Trek tweets at <a href="https://twitter.com/trek">@trek</a>.</p>
<h3>Rebecca Murphey</h3>
<h4>Config Generated Apps; or Some Other Fancier Sounding Name</h4>
<p>Rebecca will be exploring the concept of applications that are generated with configuration.
In the world where payload needs to stay small, serving up highly configurable versions of your
application can get tricky. Rebecca built <a href="http://mulberry.toura.com/">Mulberry</a> at Toura, and
has recently been working on the internal framework at <a href="http://bazaarvoice.com/">Bazaarvoice</a>,
both of which use techniques to help you generate your app instances.</p>
<p>Rebecca is a senior software engineer at Bazaarvoice and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization
and best practices at events around the world. She authored the learning site jQuery Fundamentals,
contributed to the jQuery Cookbook from O’Reilly Media, served as a technical reviewer for David
Herman’s Effective JavaScript, and created the TXJS conference (woo!). She has also created and
contributed to several open-source projects, including jQuery and Johnny Five.</p>
<h3>Frances Berriman</h3>
<h4>Culture change for creating better user experiences</h4>
<p>Building amazing digital services is a dream we all have, but many of us are working for companies that 
aren&#39;t quite with the programme yet. With a few examples from how we&#39;re making huge and lasting changes 
within the UK Government&#39;s digital services, I&#39;ll describe how you can help steer your products 
onto better seas through simple culture change tricks mostly involving watching what you say.</p>
<p>Frances is front-end development lead for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GovUK</a> in London, where she is helping to revolutionise 
digital services for citizens from the inside out.  Previously, she worked for the BBC on their JavaScript 
library and for scientific journal publisher NPG.  She blogs at <a href="http://fberriman.com/">fberriman</a> and 
tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/phae">@phae</a>.</p>

        <div class="details"><p>This set of speakers will be talking about node.js. Some new stuff, some old stuff, with info
for every skill level.</p>
<h3>Jed Schmidt</h3>
<h4>Scraping the Tree: Faking Browsers for FFUU and Profit</h4>
<p>Jed will brave the seas of serverside browsers. From implementing the DOM
in JS, to pulling in actual headless browsers, there is a lot to know
and a lot to be wary of. Luckily Jed is here to halp.</p>
<p>Jed is a javascript developer, formerly based in Tokyo, Japan, but now at home in Brooklyn. He is
the guy behind <a href="http://browserver.org/">browserver</a>, <a href="http://2011.ramendan.com/">ramendan</a>, and
<a href="http://www.140byt.es/">140byt.es</a>, and often seen on <a href="https://github.com/jed">github</a>,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tr4nslator">flickr</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jedschmidt">soundcloud</a>,
and <a href="https://twitter.com/jedschmidt">twitter</a>. There is also a javascript library
<a href="http://jedtoolkit.org/">named after him</a>.</p>
<h3>Marco Rogers</h3>
<h4>Streeeams, probably</h4>
<p>One of the best features of modern node.js applications are streams. However, these unix-y concepts
are often overlooked by folks. The performance increases and readability of streams are often a huge
win for developers. Marco will help separate the FUD from the Fact.</p>
<p>Marco is a Senior JavaScript Engineer at Yammer in San Francisco. You&#39;ve probably seen him on twitter
as <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek">@polotek</a>. He&#39;s a node expert, a member of
<a href="http://thenodefirm.com/">the Node Firm</a> and frequent open source contributor on <a href="https://github.com/polotek">github</a>.</p>
<h3>Isaac Schlueter</h3>
<h4>The Evolution of Node</h4>
<p>Isaacs has quite a bit of insight into the Node project as its project lead. As such, he is able to
describe the changes and evolution of Node.js on a macro level. There are lots of opinions and patterns
embedded into the minimal serverside JS tool and there&#39;s a reason for a lot of them. Let Isaacs tell them
at you.</p>
<p>Once a great and mighty seeker of adventure, Isaac Z. Schlueter has in recent times been reduced to a build
slave for the Node.js project. He is fascinated by pushing the limits of anarchic self-governance in open
source communities, and has an unhealthy fixation on writing JavaScript.</p>

        <div class="details"><p>This set of speakers will be talking about thinking differently. These ideas will be framed
for a technical audience but often have more to do with <strong>you</strong> than your computer.</p>
<h3>Charlie Robbins</h3>
<h4>All Open Source Everything</h4>
<p>Charlie will address what the world would look like if the barrier to entry for getting the
information to make the things you used every day was zero. What if the recipe for every food
product you ate was on the label?</p>
<p>Charlie was the first CTO at General Assembly and is currently CEO at <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodejitsu</a>, a
Node.js platform as a service company. He lives in Manhattan, tweets as
<a href="https://twitter.com/indexzero">@indexzero</a> and has quite an impressive
<a href="https://github.com/indexzero">open source</a> track record.</p>
<h3>Drew Wilson</h3>
<h4>Execute</h4>
<p>Execute is a new book by Josh Long and Drew Wilson about acting on inspiration immediately
rather than following the normal rules. They step you through the five-day build of the Space Box
app and show you in real-time how to act on inspiration. They discuss how to stay inspired until
you&#39;ve shipped and how to identify what to build in the first place. If you are building apps,
creating art, or you&#39;re a creative professional of any kind, then Execute is your new manual.
Execute was written in 3 days, designed and off to the printer in only 8 days.</p>
<p>Drew Wilson is a designer and developer (a true cross-breed powerhouse) out of Oceanside, California.
Drew created the first widely popular icon font, <a href="http://pictos.cc">Pictos</a>. He is a conference organizer,
producing <a href="http://valiocon.com/">ValioCon</a>. He’s the creator of web apps like
<a href="https://spacebox.io/">Space Box</a> and <a href="http://dialog.gs/">Dialoggs</a>. The list goes on and on. Drew tweets
at <a href="https://twitter.com/drewwilson">@drewwilson</a>.</p>

<h3>Phil Hawksworth</h3>
<h4>I can smell your CMS</h4>
<p>You make web sites. Clients want them to include all of the latest exciting fads and &quot;interface shizzle&quot;. You want them to render quickly and have a shelf-life longer than that hummus you bought the other day.  Clients want to be able to maintain the site themselves, they know about content management systems and are going to invest big money in a real belter. You know that they&#39;ll be unleashing their &#39;creativity&#39; and messing with your mojo.</p>
<p>This talk will explore the good, the bad, and the fugly of rich interfaces, and look at ways to champion what matters. We&#39;ll also look at examples of the damaging traces CMSs leave behind in the front-end and at ways to avoid the smell of your CMS wafting over to the user and sacrificing the all-important craftsmanship of good front-end engineering.</p>
<p>Phil Hawksworth is a JavaScript developer who has been developing web applications since the late 90s. These
days in his role as a Technical Director at <a href="http://rga.com">R/GA</a> in London, working for clients like Nike, O2 and Getty Images,
he focuses on technical architectures, wrangling developers and designers, and banging on about things like
unobtrusive JavaScript, open web standards and tasty browser shenanigans. Some say that his <a href="http://instagram.com/philhawksworth">Instagram</a> feed
contains more photos of cats than might be considered healthy for a grown man, but he&#39;s convinced that he
doesn&#39;t have a problem. He tweets at <a href="https://twitter.com/philhawksworth">@philhawksworth</a></p>

a bit of nice weather and plenty of stuff from the day to talk about. The party officially
