Head on over the [The Gingerman](http://goo.gl/maps/SYySn) to schmooze with other
conference goers! Argue about semicolons, bet on best talks, and preregister for
your badge while you're there. Lucky for you, this year's sponsor of all things
beer, [Bazaarvoice](https://careers-bazaarvoice.icims.com/jobs/1371/job), will be
picking up the tab. Come in, find the nerds handing out badges and tickets, and
have a good time. The free drinks end at 8pm, but feel free to stay longer and
hang out. Be sure to get a good night's sleep, the conference day starts early!
