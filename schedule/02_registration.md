Swing by [The Paramount Theatre](http://goo.gl/maps/M3nKP) during this hour to get signed
in. There will be a table and a line. If you already registered at the drink-up the night
before, feel free to come in right away (but don't forget your badge!).

Once inside, we'll provide copious amounts of delicious [TacoDeli](http://tacodeli.com/)
breakfast tacos to start your day off the Austin way. Grab a taco or two (vegetarian tacos
too!), find your friends and get seated in the theatre and get settled for the day.

### Power

We will have designated areas for power around the theatre, just look for the strips. Some
of the seats closer to the middle may have limited access. We'll also have some visible
power strips in the lobby in case you have a great idea that you need to implement before
you can continue listening.

### WiFi

Our very gracious WiFi Sponsor, [Volusion](http://www.volusion.com/careers/), has upped the
ante this year. We're doing our best to bring in some top tech to keep everyone connected
throughout the day on all 9 of their devices! That said, we appreciate your cooperation in
turning off Dropbox, automatic backups, and those Season 3 Game of Thrones torrents (the
books are better anyway). We also ask that while it's nifty to try to find yourself in the
livestream, please don't try to watch it on the conference network.
