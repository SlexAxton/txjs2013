## Welcome

Short and sweet. TXJS organizer Alex Sexton will tell you the ins-and-outs of how to maximize your
TXJS experience.

### Code of Conduct

While we want everyone to have a good time, we want to ensure that everyone feels welcome
while at TXJS. We're reluctant to post specific rules around behavior, as they always come
with loopholes. We would ask that you act in a professional manner and respect others. As
we've suggested in year's past, act as if Douglas Crockford was sitting both to the left
**and** right of you at all times. Jokes aside, if you have any trouble please
**bring it to the attention of a staff member immediately** (you can email [Alex](mailto:alexsexton+txjs@gmail.com) or find anyone with a staff badge). The staff will deal with issues promptly and privately. We reserve the right to ask especially unsavory folks to leave, but we trust y'all and aren't worried.
