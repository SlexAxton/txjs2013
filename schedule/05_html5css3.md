will be about 25 minutes.

#### HTML: Do we really need the L?

Dave will be giving an overview of how badass HTML5 is (in regards to mobile). Specifically,
what we can do with it, and how we can make things better for people.

### Nicole Sullivan
#### OOCSS and Preprocessors in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G

Many developers believe they need to choose between OOCSS and CSS preprocessors like SASS/Compass and LESS.
Nicole believes that the best sites pair the strengths of both approaches, pulling the architecture from OOCSS
and the language additions from SASS. She will share with you some of her war stories, including everything she
screwed up when switching to using preprocessors and how she finally found a balanced approach to developing
large sites using preprocessors.

Nicole is a UI performance nerd living and working in San Francisco. She helps companies make their CSS smaller
and their UI more manageable. She is also an author, most recently contributing to the Web Performance Daybook
Volume 2. Photo taken by [John Morrison](http://subism.com/).

### Chris Coyier
#### CSS is for Computers

We don't write programs in ones and zeros. We're many, many layers abstracted from that now. Those abstractions
make programming powerful and practical. With the internet, we got a fresh start with the languages it digests:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While these languages are quite a bit more "authorable" than ones and zeros, it's time
we take a step up the abstraction ladder. Using preprocessors, we can author websites in a more powerful, practical,
and efficient manner. We'll talk specifically about CSS preprocessing using Sass and Compass.
