## Lunch - 1.5 Hours

Downtown Austin is one of the best places to be hungry in the entire world. After careful consideration,
we decided that making you eat conference food within walking distance of [Frank](http://hotdogscoldbeer.com/)
would likely get us in trouble with someone.

You should be able to get in and out of most places in an hour and half, but please choose wisely if you find
yourself in a line.

Here is our **no-bull-honky list of pretty great places that you should use your eatin'-mouth at**:

* [Frank](http://goo.gl/maps/OnCN6) - Gourmet Hotdogs & Good Coffee
* [Roaring Fork](http://goo.gl/maps/VWHCn) - Fancy American (The Big Ass Burger is delicious)
* [Thai Passion](http://goo.gl/maps/o8gHO) - Pretty deece Thai Food
* [Kebabalicious](http://goo.gl/maps/TF3aM) - Delicious Falafels and Kebabs. An Austin Food Truck Stapleâ„¢
* [BD Riley's Pub](http://goo.gl/maps/TF3aM) - Good Pub Food and Beer
* [Lambert's BBQ](http://goo.gl/maps/ozc5M) - A bit further out, sometimes slow, but if you **need** BBQ, go here
* [La Condesa](http://goo.gl/maps/uFGG3) - Some of the best Mexican food in town. You'd need to move quick, though
* [Casino El Camino](http://goo.gl/maps/prqpn) - Some damn good burgers and burger mashups
* [Easy Tiger](http://goo.gl/maps/bSq3Q) - Beer Garden and Grub
* [Cafe Medici](http://goo.gl/maps/60XpP) - Not a restaurant, just damn good [Austin Texas Roasted Coffee](http://cuveecoffee.com/)

Of course, there are [lots and lots](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=food&find_loc=713+congress+ave%2C+Austin%2C+TX&ns=1&ls=6da5d99d93cb5038&open_now=1)
of other options. While you may read a lot about [Franklin Barbecue](http://franklinbarbecue.com/), they'll likely be out of
food by the time lunch starts, so go wait in line at 10am the day after the conference :D.
