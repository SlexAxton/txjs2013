## Webapps Group

This set of speakers will be talking about the ins-and-outs of building web applications. Each talk
will be about 25 minutes.

### Trek Glowacki
#### JavaScript Application Frameworks

Trek will be talking about a bit about JavaScript Application frameworks. As a user of and contributor
to many of the most popular libraries and frameworks, Trek has some unique insights into what makes
these tools different, and what their best uses are.

Trek helped start [Workantile](http://workantile.com/) and currently makes mischief in Chicago.
He's on the [Ember.JS](http://emberjs.com/) core team. [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) once
called him 'a hero'. Trek tweets at [@trek](https://twitter.com/trek).

### Rebecca Murphey
#### Config Generated Apps; or Some Other Fancier Sounding Name

Rebecca will be exploring the concept of applications that are generated with configuration.
In the world where payload needs to stay small, serving up highly configurable versions of your
application can get tricky. Rebecca built [Mulberry](http://mulberry.toura.com/) at Toura, and
has recently been working on the internal framework at [Bazaarvoice](http://bazaarvoice.com/),
both of which use techniques to help you generate your app instances.

Rebecca is a JavaScript application developer and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization
and best practices at events around the world. She authored the learning site jQuery Fundamentals,
contributed to the jQuery Cookbook from O’Reilly Media, served as a technical reviewer for David
Herman’s Effective JavaScript, and created the TXJS conference (woo!). She has also created and
contributed to several open-source projects, including jQuery and Johnny Five.

### Frances Berriman
#### Web Application UX

Whether you know it or not, “UX Designer” is in your job description. Understand more about how you
can get involved with improving experiences for your site, with a set of practical design principles
that go beyond interaction and visual design, and can be used by everyone on your team, no matter their
discipline.

Frances is front-end developer lead for [GovUK](https://www.gov.uk/) in London (where she spends a lot of
time thinking about and designing better user experiences and digital services), an evangelising admin for
[microformats.org](http://microformats.org), and is a former editor at [Digital Web](http://www.digital-web.com/).
She tweets as [@phae](https://twitter.com/phae).
