This set of speakers will be talking about the ins and outs of building web applications. Each talk
will be about 25 minutes.

### Trek Glowacki
#### JavaScript Application Frameworks

Trek will be talking a bit about JavaScript Application frameworks. As a user of and contributor
to many of the most popular libraries and frameworks, Trek has some unique insights into what makes
these tools different, and what their best uses are.

Trek helped start [Workantile](http://workantile.com/) and currently makes mischief in Chicago.
He's on the [Ember.JS](http://emberjs.com/) core team. [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) once
called him 'a hero'. Trek tweets at [@trek](https://twitter.com/trek).

### Rebecca Murphey
#### Config Generated Apps; or Some Other Fancier Sounding Name

Rebecca will be exploring the concept of applications that are generated with configuration.
In the world where payload needs to stay small, serving up highly configurable versions of your
application can get tricky. Rebecca built [Mulberry](http://mulberry.toura.com/) at Toura, and
has recently been working on the internal framework at [Bazaarvoice](http://bazaarvoice.com/),
both of which use techniques to help you generate your app instances.

Rebecca is a senior software engineer at Bazaarvoice and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization
and best practices at events around the world. She authored the learning site jQuery Fundamentals,
contributed to the jQuery Cookbook from O’Reilly Media, served as a technical reviewer for David
Herman’s Effective JavaScript, and created the TXJS conference (woo!). She has also created and
contributed to several open-source projects, including jQuery and Johnny Five.

### Frances Berriman
#### Culture change for creating better user experiences

Building amazing digital services is a dream we all have, but many of us are working for companies that 
aren't quite with the programme yet. With a few examples from how we're making huge and lasting changes 
within the UK Government's digital services, I'll describe how you can help steer your products 
onto better seas through simple culture change tricks mostly involving watching what you say.

Frances is front-end development lead for [GovUK](https://www.gov.uk/) in London, where she is helping to revolutionise 
digital services for citizens from the inside out.  Previously, she worked for the BBC on their JavaScript 
library and for scientific journal publisher NPG.  She blogs at [fberriman](http://fberriman.com/) and 
tweets as [@phae](https://twitter.com/phae).
