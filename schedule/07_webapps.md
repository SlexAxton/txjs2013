This set of speakers will be talking about the ins and outs of building web applications. Each talk
will be about 25 minutes.

### Trek Glowacki
#### Beyond Front-end Developer

In an indurstry where 
[designers skip Photoshop](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop) 
and application engineers are [moving application code into the browser](http://emberjs.com/) what 
role does the front-end developer play? We'll explore the tangled history of documents on the web, how applications came to dominate attention in the browser, and where we can go from here.

Trek helped start [Workantile](http://workantile.com/) and currently makes mischief in Chicago for 
[Groupon Engineering](https://engineering.groupon.com/). He's on the [Ember.JS](http://emberjs.com/)
core team. [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) once called him 'a 
hero'. Trek tweets at [@trek](https://twitter.com/trek).

### Rebecca Murphey
#### Apps that Build Themselves

Rebecca will be exploring the concept of applications that generate themselves from a JSON configuration, and what you need to think about if you find yourself building one. How do you build dozens or even hundreds of apps that have arbitrary combinations of components and interactions, and yet serve up a production file for each app that contains only exactly what that app needs? Rebecca will share her experience from working on [Mulberry](http://github.com/toura/mulberry) at Toura, plus what she's learned while getting to know Firebird, the internal client-side JavaScript framework used at [Bazaarvoice](http://bazaarvoice.com/).

Rebecca is a senior software engineer at Bazaarvoice and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization
and best practices at events around the world. She authored the learning site jQuery Fundamentals,
contributed to the jQuery Cookbook from O’Reilly Media, served as a technical reviewer for David
Herman’s Effective JavaScript, and created the TXJS conference (woo!). She has also
contributed to several open-source projects, including jQuery and Johnny Five. She blogs at [rmurphey.com](http://rmurphey.com) and tweets [@rmurphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphey).

### Frances Berriman
#### Culture change for creating better user experiences

Building amazing digital services is a dream we all have, but many of us are working for companies that
aren't quite with the programme yet. With a few examples from how we're making huge and lasting changes
within the UK Government's digital services, I'll describe how you can help steer your products
onto better seas through simple culture change tricks mostly involving watching what you say.

Frances is front-end development lead for [GovUK](https://www.gov.uk/) in London, where she is helping to revolutionise
digital services for citizens from the inside out.  Previously, she worked for the BBC on their JavaScript
library and for scientific journal publisher NPG.  She blogs at [fberriman](http://fberriman.com/) and
tweets as [@phae](https://twitter.com/phae).
