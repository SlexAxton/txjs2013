This set of speakers will be talking about node.js. Some new stuff, some old stuff, with info
for every skill level.

### Jed Schmidt
#### Scraping the Tree: Faking Browsers for FFUU and Profit

Jed will brave the seas of serverside browsers. From implementing the DOM
in JS, to pulling in actual headless browsers, there is a lot to know
and a lot to be wary of. Luckily Jed is here to halp.

Jed is a javascript developer, formerly based in Tokyo, Japan, but now at home in Brooklyn. He is
the guy behind [browserver](http://browserver.org/), [ramendan](http://2011.ramendan.com/), and
[140byt.es](http://www.140byt.es/), and often seen on [github](https://github.com/jed),
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tr4nslator), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jedschmidt),
and [twitter](https://twitter.com/jedschmidt). There is also a javascript library
[named after him](http://jedtoolkit.org/).

### Isaac Schlueter
#### The Evolution of Node

Isaacs has quite a bit of insight into the Node project as its project lead. As such, he is able to
describe the changes and evolution of Node.js on a macro level. There are lots of opinions and patterns
embedded into the minimal serverside JS tool and there's a reason for a lot of them. Let Isaacs tell them
at you.

Once a great and mighty seeker of adventure, Isaac Z. Schlueter has in recent times been reduced to a build
slave for the Node.js project. He is fascinated by pushing the limits of anarchic self-governance in open
source communities, and has an unhealthy fixation on writing JavaScript.

### Marco Rogers
#### Streeeams, probably

One of the best features of modern node.js applications are streams. However, these unix-y concepts
are often overlooked by folks. The performance increases and readability of streams are often a huge
win for developers. Marco will help separate the FUD from the Fact.

Marco is a Senior JavaScript Engineer at Yammer in San Francisco. You've probably seen him on twitter
as [@polotek](https://twitter.com/polotek). He's a node expert, a member of
[The Node Firm](http://thenodefirm.com/) and frequent open source contributor on [github](https://github.com/polotek).
