This set of speakers will be talking about node.js. Some new stuff, some old stuff, with info
for every skill level.

Jed will brave the seas of serverside browsers. From implementing the DOM
in JS, to pulling in actual headless browsers, there is a lot to know
and a lot to be wary of. Luckily Jed is here to halp.

Jed is a javascript developer, formerly based in Tokyo, Japan, but now at home in Brooklyn. He is
the guy behind [browserver](http://browserver.org/), [ramendan](http://2011.ramendan.com/), and
[140byt.es](http://www.140byt.es/), and often seen on [github](https://github.com/jed),
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tr4nslator), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jedschmidt),
and [twitter](https://twitter.com/jedschmidt). There is also a javascript library
[named after him](http://jedtoolkit.org/).

One of the best features of modern node.js applications are streams. However, these unix-y concepts
are often overlooked by folks. The performance increases and readability of streams is often a huge
win in both areas. Marco will help separate the FUD from the Fact.

Marco is a Senior JavaScript Engineer at Yammer in San Francisco. You've probably seen him on twitter
as [@polotek](https://twitter.com/polotek). He's a node expert, a member of
[the Node Firm](http://thenodefirm.com/) and frequent open source contributor on [github](https://github.com/polotek).

### Isaac Schlueter
#### The Evolution of Node

Isaacs has quite a bit of insight into the Node project as its project lead. As such, he is able to
describe the changes and evolution of Node.js on a macro level. There are lots of opinions and patterns
embedded into the minimal serverside JS tool and there's a reason for a lot of them. Let Isaacs tell them
at you.

Once a great and mighty seeker of adventure, Isaac Z. Schlueter has in recent times been reduced to a build
slave for the Node.js project. He is fascinated by pushing the limits of anarchic self-governance in open
source communities, and has an unhealthy fixation on writing JavaScript.
