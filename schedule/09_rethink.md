## Rethink.js Group

This set of speakers will be talking about thinking differently. These ideas will be framed
for a technical audience but often have more to do with **you** than your computer.

### Charlie Robbins
#### All Open Source Everything

Charlie will address what the world would look like if the barrier to entry for getting the
information to make the things you used every day was zero. What if the recipe for every food
product you ate was on the label?

Charlie is a General Assembly Founder and CEO at [Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/), a
Node.js platform as a service company. He lives in Manhattan, tweets as
[@indexzero](https://twitter.com/indexzero) and has quite an impressive

### Drew Wilson
#### Execute

![Drew Wilson]()

Execute is a new book by Josh Long and Drew Wilson about acting on inspiration immediately
rather than following the normal rules. They step you through the five-day build of the Space Box
app and show you in real-time how to act on inspiration. They discuss how to stay inspired until
you've shipped and how to identify what to build in the first place. If you are building apps,
creating art, or you're a creative professional of any kind, then Execute is your new manual.
Execute was written in 3 days, designed and off to the printer in only 8 days.

Drew Wilson is a designer and developer (a true cross-bread powerhouse) out of Oceanside, California.
Drew created the first widely popular icon font, [Pictos](http://pictos.cc). He is a conference organizer,
producing [ValioCon](http://valiocon.com/). Heâ€™s the creator of web apps like
[Space Box](https://spacebox.io/) and [Dialoggs](http://dialog.gs/). The list goes on and on. Drew tweets
at [@drewwilson](https://twitter.com/drewwilson).

### Phil Hawksworth
#### I can smell your CMS

The word is getting out. Great web site experiences require careful development and crafty execution
in the front end. Squeezing every drop of performance out of your user's browser is tough, but Steve
Souders and friends have mobilized an army, and we are all having a bloody good go. But there is a common
threat to doing great work in the front-end. It lurks in the back-end and clients love it. It's the content
management system, and more often than not, it stinks. We'll look at examples of the damaging traces CMSs
leave behind in the front-end and at how we might work to reduce them. We'll find ways to fight for what
matters in a CMS, and ways to avoid the smell of your CMS wafting over to the user and sacrificing
the craftsmanship of good front-end engineering.

Phil Hawksworth is a JavaScript developer who has been developing web applications since the late 90s. These
days in his role as a Technical Director at R/GA in London, working for clients like Nike, O2 and Getty Images,
he focuses on technical architectures, wrangling developers and designers, and banging on about things like
unobtrusive JavaScript, open web standards and tasty browser shenanigans. Some say that his Instagram feed
contains more photos of cats than might be considered healthy for a grown man, but he's convinced that he
doesn't have a problem. He tweets at [@philhawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth)
