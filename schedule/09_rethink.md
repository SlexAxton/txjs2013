This set of speakers will be talking about thinking differently. These ideas will be framed
for a technical audience but often have more to do with **you** than your computer.

### Charlie Robbins
#### All Open Source Everything

Charlie will address what the world would look like if the barrier to entry for getting the
information to make the things you used every day was zero. What if the recipe for every food
product you ate was on the label?

Charlie is a General Assembly Founder and CEO at [Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/), a
Node.js platform as a service company. He lives in Manhattan, tweets as
[@indexzero](https://twitter.com/indexzero) and has quite an impressive
[open source](https://github.com/indexzero) track record.

### Drew Wilson
#### Execute

Execute is a new book by Josh Long and Drew Wilson about acting on inspiration immediately
rather than following the normal rules. They step you through the five-day build of the Space Box
app and show you in real-time how to act on inspiration. They discuss how to stay inspired until
you've shipped and how to identify what to build in the first place. If you are building apps,
creating art, or you're a creative professional of any kind, then Execute is your new manual.
Execute was written in 3 days, designed and off to the printer in only 8 days.

Drew Wilson is a designer and developer (a true cross-breed powerhouse) out of Oceanside, California.
Drew created the first widely popular icon font, [Pictos](http://pictos.cc). He is a conference organizer,
producing [ValioCon](http://valiocon.com/). Heâ€™s the creator of web apps like
[Space Box](https://spacebox.io/) and [Dialoggs](http://dialog.gs/). The list goes on and on. Drew tweets
at [@drewwilson](https://twitter.com/drewwilson).

### Phil Hawksworth
#### I can smell your CMS

You make web sites. Clients want them to include all of the latest exciting fads and "interface shizzle". You want them to render quickly and have a shelf-life longer than that hummus you bought the other day.  Clients want to be able to maintain the site themselves, they know about content management systems and are going to invest big money in a real belter. You know that they'll be unleashing their 'creativity' and messing with your mojo.

This talk will explore the good, the bad, and the fugly of rich interfaces, and look at ways to champion what matters. We'll also look at examples of the damaging traces CMSs leave behind in the front-end and at ways to avoid the smell of your CMS wafting over to the user and sacrificing the all-important craftsmanship of good front-end engineering.

Phil Hawksworth is a JavaScript developer who has been developing web applications since the late 90s. These
days in his role as a Technical Director at [R/GA](http://rga.com) in London, working for clients like Nike, O2 and Getty Images,
he focuses on technical architectures, wrangling developers and designers, and banging on about things like
unobtrusive JavaScript, open web standards and tasty browser shenanigans. Some say that his [Instagram](http://instagram.com/philhawksworth) feed
contains more photos of cats than might be considered healthy for a grown man, but he's convinced that he
doesn't have a problem. He tweets at [@philhawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth)
