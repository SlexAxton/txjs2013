Held in the closest thing to a templating-language-themed bar in Austin,
[Handlebar Austin](http://goo.gl/maps/ZNreo), the TXJS after party
won't disappoint. Not if **you're** there anyways.

There will be free drinks provided by [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org)! There will be a roof
and [Jenga](http://f.cl.ly/items/0T1v010E3I3T0f1n2P1R/this-is-jenga-gif.gif), and hopefully
a bit of nice weather and plenty of stuff from the day to talk about. The party officially
ends at 11pm, but feel free to hang around or go exploring downtown. Ask a local for some
advice, or maybe just secretly follow them!

At the end of the day, pat yourself on the back. You did it!
